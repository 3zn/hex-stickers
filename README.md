# hex-stickers

Derived from the https://github.com/maxogden hexbin project, here is a place to store all current hex stickers produced by RStudio.

Remember to add a `.json` file in `meta/` with the metadata for each hex. Please use this template:

```json
{
  "name": "dplyr",
  "author": "rstudio",
  "license": "CC0",
  "raster": "https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/master/PNG/dplyr.png",
  "vector": "https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/master/SVG/dplyr.svg",
  "description": "dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation.",
  "filename": "meta/dplyr.json"
}
```
make sure name only has lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens
